      <h2>Founding Story and Mission</h2>
      <p>TechUplift Foundation was born from the shared vision of individuals who, despite lacking prior technical knowledge, gained their Information Technology education through sponsored learnership programs. Their journey illuminated a critical gap: while many young people in South Africa hold international IT certifications, they often struggle to secure jobs due to a lack of practical experience and soft skills. Witnessing this disparity firsthand, they were driven to take action.</p>
      <p>Recognizing a profound gap between the youth in marginalized communities, public schools, and the rapidly evolving ICT industry, they embarked on a mission to bridge this divide. Witnessing the transformative potential of technology education, they founded TechUplift Foundation with a resolute "why" - to empower children and youth (especially the girl child) in underserved areas with digital education and opportunities previously inaccessible to them.</p>
